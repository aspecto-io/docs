# Visualize flows into 3rd-party libraries

Using the information collected by Aspecto, you can follow data flows into third-party libraries, so you no longer have opaque paths.  This can be a powerful debugging tool, to help you understand how calls to these libraries interact  with your data. 

In the code snippet example below, a third-party library function is invoked.

With the Live Flow, you can see how this call is  translated into a  data flow, with a specific endpoint.
