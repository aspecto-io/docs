# How Do You Want to Send Your Data?

To enjoy Aspecto to the fullest, we encourage you to use our SDK to send traces.

{% content-ref url="aspecto-sdk/" %}
[aspecto-sdk](aspecto-sdk/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

However, if you already have an existing OpenTelemetry setup and prefer to keep using it, there are a couple of ways to do it.

{% content-ref url="opentelemetry/" %}
[opentelemetry](opentelemetry/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="using-opentelemetry-collector.md" %}
[using-opentelemetry-collector.md](using-opentelemetry-collector.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Or, maybe you already have an existing Jaeger setup and prefer to keep using it, you can configure its agents to send traces to Aspecto.

{% content-ref url="using-jaeger-agent.md" %}
[using-jaeger-agent.md](using-jaeger-agent.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
