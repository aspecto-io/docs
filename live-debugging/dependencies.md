# Dependencies

The Live Flows view shows the flows from other services using the same endpoints as your services. These are in the **DEPENDENCIES** tab, grouped by service and endpoint.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there are no flows in the DEPENDENCIES tab, Aspecto might not be running on your service in a [deployed environment](../deployed-environment/deployed-environment-set-up.md).
{% endhint %}
