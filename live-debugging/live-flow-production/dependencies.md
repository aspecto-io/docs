# Dependencies

The Live Flows view shows the flows from other services using the same endpoints as your services. These are in the DEPENDENCIES tab, grouped by service and endpoint.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there are no flows in the DEPENDENCIES tab,  your service might not be running in a mature environment.
{% endhint %}
