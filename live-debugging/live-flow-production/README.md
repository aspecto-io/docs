# Production Data

When you deploy your instrumented services in a production environment, you can use Live Flow to expose even more information about the data flows in your application. You can see the following details:

{% page-ref page="dependencies.md" %}

* Which services are affected by changes you make in endpoints, aka breaking changes:

{% page-ref page="breaking-changes.md" %}
