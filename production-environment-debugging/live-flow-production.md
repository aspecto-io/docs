# Visualize Production Data

You can use Aspecto in production environments, to improve your debugging capabilities. You can use the  following:

* Search for flows, and then examine them for details

{% page-ref page="flow-search.md" %}

* Use Live Flows to expose additional information about the data flows in your application

{% page-ref page="flow-visualization-in-production-environments/" %}

* See flows related to log events you are examining

{% page-ref page="logs-correlation.md" %}
