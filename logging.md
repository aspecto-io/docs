# Analyze Logs within a Flow

After [configuring your logs in Aspecto](getting-started/install/configure-logs.md), you can use the Live Flows to examine the logs at each stage of a flow. Logs are associated with the flow's diagram, giving you a strong context to what you're looking at when searching your logs.

In the info pane on the right, click _Logs._ The Logs pane will open at the bottom.

On the left, You can filter the view to show different log **severities**, filter by **service name**, or **search** for specific log records with a text search.

You can also **expand** each log to show more detail.
