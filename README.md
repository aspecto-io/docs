# What is Aspecto

Aspecto allows you to manage the complexity of your microservices, in both development and production envir~~o~~nments. It uses deep telemetry analysis of your microservices to discover how and where your endpoints are used, to detect changes when they occur, and detect the impact surface of these changes.

## What is it used for?

Use Aspecto to manage the natural changes to your microservices as your application evolves, and ensure that all parties to contracts between services implement changes so that your application doesn't break. Use it also to ensure the correct test coverage of all relevant use-cases flows before you deploy.
