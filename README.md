# Aspecto Documentation

## What is Aspecto

Aspecto allows you to manage the complexity of your microservices, in both development and production environments. It uses deep telemetry analysis  of your microservices to discover how and where your endpoints are used, and to detect changes when they occur, and detect the impact surface of these changes.

## What is it used for?

What is it  used for - Use Aspecto to  manage the natural changes to your microservices as your application evolves, and ensure that all parties to contracts between services implement changes so that your application doesn't break. Use it  also to  ensure the correct test coverage of all relevant use-cases flows before you deploy.

## What's in this doc site

This doc site explains how to instrument your microservices with Aspecto, and then how to use it at different steps of your DevOps process, including deployment to production.

**configure** - download and instrument your microservices with Aspecto in a few simple steps. Then you can immediately use Aspecto Live Flow to monitor and analyze your microservices \(or specific ones\) as they run, with real  or simulated data

**Live Flow** -  visualize actual data flows in your services in real-time

**dependency analysis  -** uncover the dependencies between services and their endpoints, including with 3rd-party libraries.  Detect when breaks appear in endpoints, where changes on one side of a contract are not implemented on the other side.

**performance** - see the actual timing of the data flows in your services, and identify possible bottlenecks.

**security**
