# Configure Aspecto

## How to install the Aspecto SDK for node.js

Aspecto uses [OpenTelemetry](www.opentelemetry.io) to collect data. 

Install it with this command:

```
$ npm install @aspecto/opentelemetry
```

### Use

In the root folder create an `aspecto.json` file with content `{"token" : "-- token goes here --"}`. Obtain your token [here](https://app.aspecto.io/app/integration).

Add this call at the top of your app entry point:

```text
require('@aspecto/opentelemetry')();
```

### Configuration

You can pass the following configuration to the Aspecto client:

| Option | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| env | string | set environment name manually instead of using `NODE_ENV` environment variable |
| aspectoAuth | UUID | set aspecto token from code instead of using `aspecto.json` |
| packageName | string | set packageName manually instead of reading it from `package.json` |
| packageVersion | string | set packageVersion manually instead of reading it from `package.json` |
| local | boolean | when set to true, enable [live flows](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspecto/opentelemetry#live-flows) |
| isolate | boolean | when set to true, enable isolated mode for [live flows](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspecto/opentelemetry#live-flows) |
| liveExporterPort | number | specify port for [live flows](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspecto/opentelemetry#live-flows) |
| logger | logger interface | logger to be used in this tracing library. common use for debugging `logger: console` |
| customZipkinEndpoint | URL | Send all traces to additional Zipkin server for debug |
| samplingRatio | number | By default, Aspecto will collect all traces in the application, but sometimes it might be desirable to reduce the amount of traces and collect only a sampling of the traces. By setting the `samplingRatio` parameter to a value in range \[0.0, 1.0\] you can control the amount of traces starting in this service which will be probability sampled. This parameter has no influence on traces that start in other services and call the current instance, so a distributed trace is either completely sampled or completely dropped but no partial traces are expected. |

### Live Flows

Live Flows captures all payloads and traces in your local environment and automatically extracts the topology & dependencies between endpoints. 

Activate it using `{local:true}`, like this:

```text
require('@aspecto/opentelemetry')({ local: true });
```

Live flows works in two modes:

* connected
* isolated

#### Connected mode

This is the default mode. It allows you to capture flows from all the microservices that you're running locally \(both on the host env and docker\) with `local` mode enabled. Once the process starts it will output the following link:

```text
=====================================================================================================================================
|                                                                                                                                   |
| üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSee the live tracing stream at https://app.aspecto.io/app/live-flows/sessions?instanceId=14243e72-14dc-4255-87af-ef846b247578   |
|                                                                                                                                   |
=====================================================================================================================================
```

Click on the link to open the Live Flow, to see traces from all the microservices that are running on your environment that have local mode enabled. The link is valid for a limited period of time \(a couple of days, but it may change in the future\).   
If you don't see a trace from some microservice \(or none of them\), click the newly-generated link.

#### Isolated mode

In this mode, you can only see flows from one microservice. Also, in this case, all the data is being sent directly to the browser. To activate isolated mode use `isolate` option like so:

```text
require('@aspecto/opentelemetry')({ local: true, isolate: true });
```

In isolated mode, the message in the console will look like this \(with `port` parameter\):

```text
===============================================================================================
|                                                                                             |
| üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è See the live tracing stream at https://app.aspecto.io/app/live-flows/sessions?port=59778 |
|                                                                                             |
===============================================================================================
```

Note: If the Live Flows port is not static, add the environment variable `ASPECTO_LIVE_PORT=59778` in order for Live Flows to work in isolated mode when running the service in the container the port that is used by live flows has to be published \(https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking\).
